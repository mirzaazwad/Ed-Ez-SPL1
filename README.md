## Tools used:

1) HTML(Front End Skeleton)
2) CSS(Front End Presentation)
3) Javascript (Client-Side Scripting/Front-End)
4) Php (Server-Side Scripting/Backend)
5) MySQL (Database)

We used bootsrap as our CSS modules that helped further improve the presentation of our website and helped ensure responsiveness.

Vanilla Javascript was used as the requirement of this project was that no frameworks could be used for client-side or server-side scripting. But we did use JQuery for better responsiveness. Full Calendar Plugin was used for event tracking.

Also Vanilla Php was used due to the same constraint

The database used was mySQL as it was recommended to use a SQL database(relational)

We used xaamp to help manipulate these components with phpmyadmin to manage the mySQL-based database. Further details about the project can be found in the docs section.
