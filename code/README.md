This directory also contains a small helpful documentation of how the current LibraryFiles are working. It also contains a brief usage manual for each of the existing functionalities(library functionalities).

## LoginAuth

This Directory contains the Login and SignUp options as well as the forgot password option. In the future we may also implement an email verification option which is not yet added.

## UserProfiles

This Directory contains the code implementations for the StudentProfile and TeacherProfile along with Logout options and an UpdatePassword option that is accessible from both types of profiles(student and teacher). The Logout option is also accessible by both types of profiles as needed when the Logout option/button is selected from any of the profiles.

## Tools used:

1) HTML(Front End Skeleton)
2) CSS(Front End Presentation)
3) Javascript (Client-Side Scripting/Front-End)
4) Php (Server-Side Scripting/Backend)
5) MySQL (Database)

We used bootsrap as our CSS modules that helped further improve the presentation of our website and helped ensure responsiveness.

Vanilla Javascript was used as the requirement of this project was that no frameworks could be used for client-side or server-side scripting

Also Vanilla Php was used due to the same constraint

The database used was mySQL as it was recommended to use a SQL database(relational)

We used xaamp to help manipulate these components with phpmyadmin to manage the mySQL-based database. Further details about the project can be found in the docs section.
